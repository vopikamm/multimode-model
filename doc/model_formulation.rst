Model Formulation
=================

This section summarizes the mathematical foundation of the project. For full details, please refer to the relevant chapters of the thesis:

- **Derivation of the Model Equations**  
  See Chapter 2 in the manuscript:  
  `Derivation of the Model Equations (PDF) <_static/thesis.pdf#page=5>`_

- **Nonlinear Multimode Model**  
  See Chapter 3 in the thesis:  
  `Nonlinear Multimode Model (PDF) <_static/thesis.pdf#page=21>`_

These chapters contain the full derivation of the continuous governing equations and their numerical discretization.
