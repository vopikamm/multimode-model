Model Formulation
=================

This section summarizes the mathematical foundation of the project. For full details, please refer to the relevant chapters of the thesis:

- **Derivation of the Model Equations**  
  See Chapter 3 in the thesis:  
  `Derivation of the Model Equations (PDF) <_static/thesis.pdf#page=25>`_

- **Nonlinear Multimode Model**  
  See Chapter 4 in the thesis:  
  `Nonlinear Multimode Model (PDF) <_static/thesis.pdf#page=40>`_

These chapters contain the full derivation and analysis of the governing equations used in the simulation and numerical implementation.
