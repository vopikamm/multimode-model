In this case, we want to solve the above equations on a rectangular domain that has a uniform grid spacing where the two spatial directions are always perpendicular to each other. Put more simply, we want to work on a cartesian grid. More precisely, we choose a representation of the prognostic variables such that they are defined on individual cartesian grids which are shifted to each other. This is called a staggered grid and for the problem at hand, the [Arakawa C-grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakawa_grids#Arakawa_C-grid) is the best choice.\n",
