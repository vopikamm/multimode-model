# Multimode Model

Implementation of a non-linear ocean model which expresses the state as a projection onto vertical normal modes. Hence, the vertical coordinate is quasi-continuous but the vertical resolution is limited by the truncation in vertical mode space.

For more details about the model formulation have a look at the relevant [documentation](https://mcgroup.pages.geomar.de/multimode-model/model_formulation.html). The documentation also contains an extensive [contributing guide](https://mcgroup.pages.geomar.de/multimode-model/contributing.html) to encourage everyone to join the development.
